The portfolio is simple and anyone can edit and use it, no problem. Please change the Instagram link, LinkedIn link, Twitter link, CV, and resume.

In the 'Have a Question?' section:

In the portfolio, we used Web3Forms for sending all data entered to my email address via this website. In Web3Forms, 
just sign up and provide your email address. 
Web3Forms provides an Access Key like this: '91e4ee9b-90d3-401d-97ce-9849234e22209'. Please replace it with my Access Key.

If you have any doubts, you can contact me by messaging there.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance or modifications.
